Nothing to see here yet!

Here are my goals for this project:
It needs to be easy and intuitive to use

- Due to the nature of people, there is not one config that will be easy and intuitive for everyone to use
- For this reason, I am adopting an approach of sensible defaults with the option to configure things that are common to vary from person to person.

I want this keyboard layout to be easily ported onto any keyboard

The smallest fully functional layout will work on a 34 key corne

This layout should be gaming friendly

Ergonomics come second to ease of use, but ergonomics are definately a thought

Configurables are:
Board
Shield
Left Space-Right Space
Layout (QWERTY vs COLEMAK CH)
"Homerow" mods
